Everyone in our society has had to make a contribution towards dealing with the debts.;George Osborne;society

Men must stop being jealous of their power and generously allow freedom and responsibility to others. The reward is harmonious families and society.;Delphine de Girardin;society

I think it's great that we have organisations like Greenpeace. In a pluralistic society, we want to have people who point out all the problems that the Earth could encounter. But we need to understand that they are not presenting a full and rounded view.;Bjorn Lomborg;society
Economic progress, in capitalist society, means turmoil.;Joseph A. Schumpeter;society

And the truth is, those who are terrorists only have to succeed once, and those of us who are trying to build an inclusive society have to succeed every time.;David Miliband;society
I mean, Britain is a country of successful Muslim businesspeople, teachers and educators, journalists. So, we have to say very strongly that the two million plus Muslims in Britain, the vast bulk of them make a huge contribution to our society, and they actually make it the vibrant society it is.;David Miliband;society
As a society, I think we express our cultural mores through our politics. We're trying constantly to figure out what's OK and what's not OK. And it's hard, because our society is constantly buffeted by gale force winds of technology. Things are always changing.;Daniel H. Wilson;society
The only thing of value I have in this life is my ability to tell a story, whether in print, orating, writing it down or having people acting it out. That's why I'm always hoping society never collapses because the first ones to go will be entertainers.;Kevin Smith;society
Because society places a value on masculinity, gay men aspire to it. If you go to a gay club and the doorman says, 'You do realise this is a gay club, don't you lads?' you get all excited because you think, 'Wow, he thought I was straight!';Graham Norton;society
In all of our society, but especially in Hollywood, there is an obsession with perfection that can lead to self-loathing and neurosis and all that kind of stuff.;Ethan Hawke;society

As far as hypnosis is concerned, I had a very serious problem when I was in my twenties. I encountered a man who later became the president of the American Society of Medical Hypnosis. He couldn't hypnotize me.;Theodore Sturgeon;society

And from a military school which taught me that to fit into society, you can't just do anything you damn well please because it will suit you. And that it's much better to be with the winners than it is with the losers.;Sam Donaldson;society
The Chinese art world does not exist. In a society that restricts individual freedoms and violates human rights, anything that calls itself creative or independent is a pretence. It is impossible for a totalitarian society to create anything with passion and imagination.;Ai Weiwei;society
If we all say the same thing, then I think the government has to listen. But because no one is saying it, I become singled out, even though what I'm saying is common sense. It's very essential values that we all have to protect. But in Chinese society, people are giving up on protecting these values.;Ai Weiwei;society
I'm really not interested in other people's opinions, because I think frankly most of those opinions are either misinformed and adding to this endless ball of hot air we have in our society where everyone thinks their opinion is valuable and sacred and what counts.;H. G. Bissinger;society
Men are beginning to realize that they are not individuals but persons in society, that man alone is weak and adrift, that he must seek strength in common action.;Dorothy Day;society
Police in China can do whatever they want after 81 days in arbitrary detention you clearly realise that they don't have to obey their own laws.

You're scrutinized all through your life - you're scrutinized by your family, by yourself, by society, and your friends in a certain way, shape, or form.;Colin Farrell;society

He who negates present society, and seeks social conditions based on the sharing of property, is a revolutionary whether he calls himself an anarchist or a communist.;Johann Most;society

The only yardstick for success our society has is being a champion. No one remembers anything else.;John Madden;society
I hope one day I will host my own charity event to give back to society.;Yani Tseng;society
Once boys' and men's challenges are clear, the question 'why now' quickly becomes 'why didn't we see this sooner?' The answer? Virtually every society that survived did so by socializing its sons to be disposable.;Warren Farrell;society
I've always thought of acting as a tool to change society. I watch a lot of actors and I see panic in their eyes because they don't know why they act and I know why I act. Whether I'm a good or a bad actor, I know why I do it.;Andy Serkis;society
Do not ghettoize society by putting people into legal categories of gender, race, ethnicity, language, or other such characteristics.;Preston Manning;society
So if we have anything original to offer, it's to speak from our own life about the society we're in.;Sean Penn;society
It is in Saudi Arabia's best interest to allow women to fully participate in its society, and this includes the right to vote and run for office.;Barbara Boxer;society
Watching people just look out for themselves, I think, is extremely interesting. It goes right back to something like 'The Beggar's Opera' - the underbelly of society, how it operates, and how that reflects their so-called betters.;Peter Mullan;society
The real point is that totalitarian regimes have claimed jurisdiction over the whole person, and the whole society, and they don't at all believe that we should give unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and unto God that which is God's.;Jeane Kirkpatrick;society
The British are supposed to be particularly averse to intellectuals, a prejudice closely bound up with their dislike of foreigners. Indeed, one important source of this Anglo-Saxon distaste for highbrows and eggheads was the French revolution, which was seen as an attempt to reconstruct society on the basis of abstract rational principles.;Terry Eagleton;society
Those who suffer are not those at the top, but are the less privileged members of society.;Bianca Jagger;society

Manners are the basic building blocks of civil society.;Alexander McCall Smith;society

And I feel that we in our society should not be held by any such myth that we should do everything we can to gain a delight and joy in our society with all the available parts of the palette.;Minoru Yamasaki;society
Taxation is the price we pay for failing to build a civilized society. The higher the tax level, the greater the failure. A centrally planned totalitarian state represents a complete defeat for the civilized world, while a totally voluntary society represents its ultimate success.;Mark Skousen;society
All you now do is pursue your private objectives within society. Instead of us being a community, everybody is asked to seek their own personal ends. It's called competition. And competition is antagonism.;Edward Bond;society
Art is the close scrutiny of reality and therefore I put on the stage only those things that I know happen in our society.;Edward Bond;society
Religion enabled society to organise itself to debate goodness, just as Greek drama had once done.;Edward Bond;society
The human mind is a dramatic structure in itself and our society is absolutely saturated with drama.;Edward Bond;society

The chief product of an automated society is a widespread and deepening sense of boredom.;C. Northcote Parkinson;society

That person has to be accountable for himself. I think that's what we have to do in society today is to be accountable for yourself. I think we have the tendency to always want to live someone else's life.;Herschel Walker;society
If education does not create a need for the best in life, then we are stuck in an undemocratic, rigid caste society.;Sargent Shriver;society
Too much of our society looks for people to fail.;Roger Goodell;society
Our guiding principle was that design is neither an intellectual nor a material affair, but simply an integral part of the stuff of life, necessary for everyone in a civilized society.;Walter Gropius;society
This is actually a very important principle that science is learning about large systems like evolution and that futurists are learning about anticipating human society: just because a future scenario is plausible doesn't mean we can get there from here.;Kevin Kelly;society
I don't believe society understands what happens when everything is available, knowable and recorded by everyone all the time.;Eric Schmidt;society
