Today there are people trying to take away rights that our mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers fought for: our right to vote, our right to choose, affordable quality education, equal pay, access to health care. We the people can't let that happen.;Kerry Washington;health
Rogue internet pharmacies continue to pose a serious threat to the health and safety of Americans. Simply put, a few unethical physicians and pharmacists have become drug suppliers to a nation.;Dianne Feinstein;health
I'm nutty for nutrition. I've become one of those people who can't stop talking about the connection between food and health. Now that I know how much changing what you eat can transform your life, I can't stop proselytizing.;Robin Quivers;health
There was never going to be a right time for a band that was still recording and had health in its environment, had made a very good record and was playing well.;Peter Garrett;health

My top three priorities for my first term in Congress are growing our economy providing for quality, affordable health care and keeping our nation and communities safe.;Cathy McMorris;health
I do see women voters shifting to the Republican Party and doing so significantly. And the issue that's doing this is the fear the federal government will prevail in making the Affordable Health Care Act permanent law and how that will hurt small businesses.;Cathy McMorris;health
Women oftentimes are the ones making those economic decisions, sitting around the kitchen table and trying to figure out how to pay for rising gas prices or food prices or the health insurance costs. And I think that they see where they expect their leaders in Congress to also make those tough decisions.;Cathy McMorris;health
Canada is currently the only major industrialized country in the world that does not allow any private administration of health care services that are provided by the public system.;Cliff Stearns;health

Health care is the No. 1 concern of small businesses and the status quo is untenable.;Karen Mills;health
We see tremendous excitement from small-business people about the administration and about the attention and commitment that the president has to do things that really make a difference. I think they recognize that health care is one of those. I think they recognize that what we've been doing in the Recovery Act with our loan programs has mattered.;Karen Mills;health
We don't want the efficiency of the federal government and the compassion of the IRS to run our health care.;Todd Akin;health
The great equalizer is health. If you don't have it, you're screwed.;Jami Gertz;health
The reason Gov. Romney passed Romneycare as governor of Massachusetts in 2006 was because many Republicans viewed health care reform, mandates and all, as a way to inoculate against Democratic charges that Republicans didn't care about people who lacked health insurance.;Ari Fleischer;health
Well, what did we buy? Instead of a leaner, smarter government, we bought a bureaucracy that now tells us which light bulbs to buy, and which will put 16,500 IRS agents in charge of policing President Obama's health care bill.;Michele Bachmann;health
I'm up here in Cleveland tonight and there are a lot of folks who are concerned about it. Twenty-five percent of the people up here get their health care through religious organizations and so that religious freedom issue is very important to them.;Rob Portman;health
Americans oppose Obamacare because they understand that it is inconsistent with our liberties and our idea of limited government and that it will destroy the best health care system in the world.;David Limbaugh;health
And in terms of their crown jewel legislative achievement: who knew that when asked, 'will government impose a new federal mandate requiring middle class Americans to buy health insurance whether they can afford it or not?' The answer would be 'Yes we can!';Artur Davis;health
The more you worry, the more you throw off the delicate balance of hormones required for health.;Andrew Bernstein;health
The truth is that stress doesn't come from your boss, your kids, your spouse, traffic jams, health challenges, or other circumstances. It comes from your thoughts about these circumstances.;Andrew Bernstein;health
Five years ago we were working on a new album when my health began failing.;Lou Gramm;health
America enjoys the best health care in the world, but the best is no good if folks can't afford it, access it and doctor's can't provide it.;Bill Frist;health
I can support co-ops if they want to do it as we've known co-ops in America for 150 years - where they serve the purposes of the consuming public, whether it's health care or whether it's co-ops as we know them in the Midwest, providing electricity or to sell supplies to farmer.;Chuck Grassley;health
Decades ago, women suffered through horrifying back-alley abortions. Or, they used dangerous methods when they had no other recourse. So when the Republican Party launched an all-out assault on women's health, pushing bills to limit access to vital services, we had to ask: Why is the GOP trying to send women back... to the back alley?;Lisa Edelstein;health
It's been a long road back to health and fitness for me. I am just glad to have been given the opportunity to do what I love most.;Jonah Lomu;health
In choosing global corporate partners UNICEF emphasises compatibility with our core values and looks to build alliances that advance our mission of ensuring the health, education, equality and protection for all the world's children.;Carol Bellamy;health

San Francisco businesses face many challenges, including high rents, regulatory burdens, and the rising cost of workers compensation insurance and employee health plans.;Gavin Newsom;health
Not really in all honesty because until you take control of your own health and go to your own doctor and have your own doctor tell you what's going to work for you.;Star Jones;health
It is essential that the women's preventive coverage benefit, including contraception, be available to all women, regardless of what health plan they have or where they work - as Congress intended. Providing access to birth control just makes good sense.;Gwen Moore;health
It is important for women to have a choice, to have an opportunity to plan their families, because if they don't, the Republicans have said this is an ownership society. You are on your own, and they're going to begrudge that child everything, from WIC to a Pell Grant to health insurance.;Gwen Moore;health
Too many of my constituents, like many other hard working Americans across the country, are suffering unnecessarily due to our flawed health care system.;John Conyers;health
The time is now for Congress to address health care in America.;John Conyers;health
Our system of private health insurance that fails to provide coverage to so many of our citizens also contributes to the double-digit health care inflation that is making America less competitive in the global economy.;John Conyers;health
In this most powerful nation in the world, lack of access to health care should not force local and state governments, companies and workers into bankruptcy, while causing unnecessary illness and hospitalization.;John Conyers;health
All Americans should have access to quality, affordable health care.;Christopher Dodd;health
Working families need to know that we will work to protect their health needs, promote the development of safe, effective medicines, and guarantee patient rights.;Christopher Dodd;health

We need a vibrant Medicaid program and strategies to expand affordable access to health care for all, especially for the specialty care services that community health centers do not provide.;Jan Schakowsky;health
In Illinois, community, migrant, homeless and public housing health centers operate 268 primary care sites and serve close to 1 million patients every year.;Jan Schakowsky;health
Each and every day health centers provide high-quality primary and preventive care to our constituents.;Jan Schakowsky;health
Community health centers do a great deal with limited resources. They provide critical medical care services to many who would otherwise have no other place to go or would end up in an emergency room.;Jan Schakowsky;health
As grateful as we are for all the work the community health centers do, it is also important that we recognize that they cannot solve the health care crisis facing our Nation by themselves.;Jan Schakowsky;health
Therefore in medicine we ought to know the causes of sickness and health.;Avicenna;health
Unfortunately, we are still in an age where individuals may be discriminated against because of health conditions.;Lois Capps;health

I want to thank the efforts of the American Public Health Association and its 200-plus partners who have organized events around the Nation that serve to raise everyone's awareness of the need to improve public health.;Lois Capps;health
It is great good health to believe, as the Hindus do, that there are 33 million gods and goddesses in the world. It is great good health to want to understand one's dreams. It is great good health to desire the ambiguous and paradoxical.;Clive Barker;health
I know that it isn't just violence against women, it's how do we support ourselves and our families, how do we deal with health care for ourselves and our families? It's a bigger picture.;Patricia Ireland;health

Health care for all Americans is the most pressing domestic issue today. It's far past time for the President and Congress to deliver health care to everyone.;Russ Feingold;health
Well, my view is that the insurance companies have done awfully well and spent a lot of money on a lot of things that don't have anything to do with health care.;Russ Feingold;health
Coal is absolutely critical to our nation's economic health and global competitiveness.;Jerry Costello;health
While some people are certainly seeing economic benefits, many others are unemployed, underemployed, without health insurance and struggling to make ends meet.;Jerry Costello;health

The main thing is that it's nice to see these young people - 9 to 14 years old - take the opportunity to get more involved in their health and fitness. We need more kids to be more active.;Rafer Johnson;health
As patients and consumers, we are better informed today about our health care than any previous generation.;Patricia Hewitt;health
A modern health and social care system has to be completely focussed on the needs of its users.;Patricia Hewitt;health
Health has always been an important thing to me. I exercise and try to take care of myself, and drink a lot of water! And I push that to my kids so that they can carry on that same energy.;Doug E. Fresh;health
We face a choice this election. President Obama is fighting for changes that grow the economy from the middle out and help all Americans succeed - jobs, education, health reform, the DREAM Act, equal pay for women. He is moving us forward with opportunity today for prosperity tomorrow. Mitt Romney wants to take us back to yesterday.;Eva Longoria;health
Despite Arizona's remarkable growth in recent years, we have met the current federal health standards for ozone pollution and the Environmental Protection Agency recently approved our dust control plan.;Jane D. Hull;health
During the last regular session and the most recent special session, measures that I see as little more than Band-Aids were applied to three health programs in the state.;Jane D. Hull;health
It is time to maximize and prioritize our health care dollars.;Jane D. Hull;health
Of course the EU and member states must work to ensure that people moving from one country to another understand their obligations and their rights in areas like health, road safety and further education.;John Bruton;health
If bringing up the next generation is important, why aren't they the best qualified, the best paid? Why aren't we as concerned about their career progression as we are about those who work in the education or health services?;Estelle Morris;health

Our health care system is the finest in the world, but we still have too many uninsured Americans, too high prices for prescription drugs, and too many frivolous lawsuits driving our physicians out of state or out of business.;Judy Biggert;health
But I don't want to be out there anymore I don't want people asking me about my health issues, about my kids. I choose not to be a public paparazzi girl on purpose.;Toni Braxton;health
The time to read is any time: no apparatus, no appointment of time and place, is necessary. It is the only art which can be practiced at any hour of the day or night, whenever the time and inclination comes, that is your time for reading in joy or sorrow, health or illness.;Holbrook Jackson;health
We can all agree that no American should lose their life savings or their home because of illness or injury and that the rising cost of health care severely burdens individuals, families and businesses.;Judd Gregg;health
At least Obama was half-way honest about how much he was going to spend on health care. He had it at $600 billion. And the real number... is $1.2 trillion.;Judd Gregg;health
As the GAO report recognizes, the long-term health of our forests relies on additional fuel reduction options and funding to reduce the risks that catastrophic fire poses to our nation's ecosystems, communities and federal budgetary resources.;Greg Walden;health
And what we're doing in Ohio is we're moving from a basic manufacturing economy to one that's diversified, including energy and health care and agriculture and IT.;John Kasich;health
But, at the end of the day, we need to represent the taxpayers who have made enormous sacrifices. Many have lost their jobs. Many of them have seen their companies - they don't have a pension - they have seen their companies cut the match for their 401(k). They have seen their health care benefits be shredded.;John Kasich;health
In addition, California spends nearly $1 billion a year in Medi-Cal services for an average of 780,000 illegal immigrants a month, over and above emergency health services.;Elton Gallegly;health

Today right here in America we have 50 million people without health insurance.;Corrine Brown;health
You know, for most seniors Medicare is their only form of health care.;Corrine Brown;health
My cooking philosophy, what I try to do, is to make a cuisine where the produce and the product shines, compared to some current trends that are maybe more adding additional things, like molecular cuisine, with a lot of additives and chemicals, which are now showing that they could be bad for your health.;Joel Robuchon;health
I've never followed a vegan or vegetarian diet in the past, but I think I could do it. It would not be easy. I have worked with nutritionists who have said a vegan diet is not necessarily all positive for your health, because you need nutrients you only find in meats. I believe in a balanced diet.;Joel Robuchon;health
Taste is developed by the diversity of the products one can sample. I think our children today may be missing an education about food. We must teach them to know their cuisine and to know the equilibrium of nourishment. That is very important for health.;Joel Robuchon;health
Raising taxes is the last thing we should do amid the weakest economic recovery since World War II. Unfortunately, even if we avoid the full 'Taxmageddon' scenario, President Obama's health care law also contains a new surtax on investment that will take effect in 2013.;John Cornyn;health
By the Obama administration's reasoning, it would be constitutionally permissible to make Americans purchase nearly any product (broccoli, gym membership) that improved their health and thereby contributed to lower health-care costs.;John Cornyn;health
Think for a moment about what Obamacare has done: The federal government has come up with its own (ever-evolving) definition of 'health insurance,' which now includes free access to sterilization, contraception, and certain abortifacients such as the morning-after pill.;John Cornyn;health
If Obamacare is allowed to stand - and Congress is allowed to make the purchase of government-endorsed health insurance compulsory - there will be no meaningful limit on Washington's reach into the lives of the American people. That is certainly not what the Founders intended.;John Cornyn;health
Illegal drug use runs contrary to the image of health depicted by cycling. Distributors of these drugs must be prosecuted more harshly as they are ciminals.;Bernard Hinault;health
The health industry, the fitness industry, was really starting to pick up. This was around the mid 80's.;Warren Cuccurullo;health
The result was, of course, that today, tragically, more than 40 million Americans don't have health insurance, and for many, not having health insurance means they don't have access to good health care.;George J. Mitchell;health
I brought together experts from health care, business, academic institutions, and the community to develop a comprehensive blueprint for eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care in the City of Boston.;Thomas Menino;health
