It's hard to say exactly what it is about face-to-face contact that makes deals happen, but whatever it is, it hasn't yet been duplicated by technology.;Paul Graham;technology
I'm the one who made many of the bold comments that we'd seen the technologies from AMD as pretty good. Their technology in many areas was leading. But those are transient.;Kevin Rollins;technology
Intel's still our main partner. We have not announced anything with AMD and don't have anything planned, but we're constantly being aware to make sure our customers get the best technology.;Kevin Rollins;technology
Ajax isn't a technology. It's really several technologies, each flourishing in its own right, coming together in powerful new ways.;Jesse James Garrett;technology
Any powerful technology can be abused.;K. Eric Drexler;technology
My greatest concern is that the emergence of this technology without the appropriate public attention and international controls could lead to an unstable arms race.;K. Eric Drexler;technology
But while doing that I'd been following a variety of fields in science and technology, including the work in molecular biology, genetic engineering, and so forth.;K. Eric Drexler;technology

Most technological advances in our life now come from serendipitous discoveries. That is a contraction of rocket technology and computer technology and atomic clock technology.;Serge Haroche;technology
We are involved in technology development for, you know, missions that we hope to plan that would take us to an asteroid and eventually to Mars.;Ellen Ochoa;technology
In fact, I argue that the future of advertising, whatever the technology, will be to associate each brand with one word. This is one word equity. It's the modern equivalent of having the best site on the high street, except the location is in the mind.;Maurice Saatchi;technology
For a long time many believed that there would be an automatic adjustment and counted on a rapid increase in the wages of the emerging nations, on our advances in technology and the costs of transport preventing disruption. But this reassuring analysis is out of date.;Laurent Fabius;technology
The demographic weight of countries such as China and India exercise a massive pressure on our wages and salaries. They have accomplished massive technological advances and the revolution in information technology has reduced the costs of transport.;Laurent Fabius;technology
Thus, after finishing high school, I started with high expectations and enthusiasm to study chemistry at the famous Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.;Richard Ernst;technology
We were promised a simpler life, and technology has only complicated our lives.;Freeman Thomas;technology

This is like the telephone problem - no one wants to have the first one. But we are seeing a lot of people who want some sort of technology to solve the spam problem.;Eric Allman;technology
I think one of the greatest enemies in the use of technology, however, is the idea that if you use the technology you have to throw other things out of the window.;John Eaton;technology
Agency by agency, we frequently have lost a bit of ground, at least to inflation-but had it not been for the efforts we've made to educate people about the importance of science, technology and advanced education, those predictions very well might have come true.;Charles Vest;technology
For much of this decade, both Congressional and administration budget projections showed a decline in science and technology accounts of between 20 and 30 percent in real dollars. The real impact to date has been far less severe.;Charles Vest;technology
Looking ahead, I believe that the underlying importance of higher education, of science, of technology, of research and scholarship to our quality of life, to the strength of our economy, to our security in many dimensions will continue to be the most important message.;Charles Vest;technology
They've just gone over the line in my opinion, and again, there's a proper time for a pat down, there's a proper time for an advanced technology body search, but it has to be done with some thought.;John Mica;technology
I try to write about how we live today, how we use language, technology, our bodies.;Dana Spiotta;technology

People often pulled into Scientology want to address personal problems in their life, and Scientology says we have technology that addresses these kinds of problems. Just focusing on the problems and trying to remedy them can be helpful.;Lawrence Wright;technology
As social media is less about technology and more about relationship building, we are starting to see more women have a heavy influence if not dominant role in the social media space. It's no wonder that Facebook is being run in part by chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg.;Erik Qualman;technology
At a minimum the majority of search dollars will flow to a social media model because people care most about what their peers think and the technology is there for that information to be quickly shared on products and services.;Erik Qualman;technology
With this CD technology, you can just remix a record right there on the spot.;Jam Master Jay;technology
The technology is just so far gone. It's just like back in the day you needed a suitcase just to have a cell phone. The battery was so heavy, it was like carrying a gallon of soda around with you all day.;Jam Master Jay;technology
If I was designing a web site for elementary school children, I might have a much higher percentage of older computers with outdated browsers since keeping up with browser and hardware technology has not traditionally been a strong point of most elementary schools.;Mike Davidson;technology
Even when I work with computers, with high technology, I always try to put in the touch of the hand.;Issey Miyake;technology

Technology will eventually destroy the way schools are run now.;Daniel Greenberg;technology
I had an almost fetishistic attraction to film technology.;Lars von Trier;technology

Why doesn't Apple stop for a year and make medical devices?

The rapid dissemination of technology and information offers entirely new ways of production, but it can also bring the spectre of more states developing weapons of mass destruction.;Lord Robertson;technology
Everything's changed. The technology is the big thing changing now, the way movies like 'Alice' or 'Avatar' are made. And technology on the other side, the audience side. Word spreads so fast now on a movie, with the Internet, and piracy is something coming down the line like in the music industry.;Richard D. Zanuck;technology
The technology is really where all of the changes have taken place, but the fundamentals of a good story being the basis of every good picture, and really the only basis still remains the rule, more so today, I think, because we've unfortunately weaned an audience from birth to kind of mindless movies.;Richard D. Zanuck;technology
Today, the forces of competition, technology, and globalization have converged to spur innovation and to transform the way business is done in the securities industry.;Arthur Levitt;technology
