I learned very early that our health is always impaired by some excess either of food or abstinence, and I never had any physician except myself.;Giacomo Casanova;health
My personal feeling, if I can interject a political note, is that I don't think it is right that basic health care is a privilege. It shouldn't be. It should be a right of all human beings. And certainly in the richest country in the world.;Bryan Cranston;health
I try to stay positive by focusing on how much I'll appreciate my health if I get better.;Daniel Johns;health
Furthermore, we believe that health care reform, again I said at the beginning of my remarks, that we sent the three pillars that the President's economic stabilization and job creation initiatives were education and innovation - innovation begins in the classroom - clean energy and climate, addressing the climate issues in an innovative way to keep us number one and competitive in the world with the new technology, and the third, first among equals I may say, is health care, health insurance reform.;Nancy Pelosi;health
I think about my parents all the time, especially on Sunday when I'm at Mass. My mother always said, 'We do not pray to win elections. We pray for people's health, we pray that God's will be done, we pray that we do our best. But we do not pray to win elections.';Nancy Pelosi;health
For me, I am left leaning when it comes to health and education, on the right when it comes to defense. So I don't know where I come on the political spectrum. And I think this the challenge that a lot of Jordanians have to deal with.;King Abdullah II;health
Children born to teens have less supportive and stimulating environments, poorer health, lower cognitive development, and worse educational outcomes. Children of teen mothers are at increased risk of being in foster care and becoming teen parents themselves, thereby repeating the cycle.;Jane Fonda;health
Looking after my health today gives me a better hope for tomorrow.;Anne Wilson Schaef;health
Look, I hate to sound like Pollyanna, but I literally can't wait to get to work in the morning. I've got steady jobs, I've got my health, and I'm here in the greatest city in the world. I'd be a pig not to be grateful.;Christopher Meloni;health
As the National Football League and other pro sports increasingly reckon with the early dementia, mental health issues, suicides and even criminal behavior of former players, the risk of what's known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), is becoming clear.;Jeffrey Kluger;health
There's no one place a virus goes to die - but that doesn't make its demise any less a public health victory. Throughout human history, viral diseases have had their way with us, and for just as long, we have hunted them down and done our best to wipe them out.;Jeffrey Kluger;health
And I believe that if we can care about whether or not our neighbor has a good job or access to affordable health care for their children, and we move to implement the policies that can improve these situations, we will unleash vast amounts of human potential and recapture the American spirit.;Tim Ryan;health
Our children's health and well-being are dependent on our commitment to promoting food access and good eating habits at home, at school and in the community.;Rod Blagojevich;health
If you're going to vote on a television contract, there is a certain rationality to saying that the same structures that are applied to Health Plan participation should be placed on the right to vote on a strike.;Dick Wolf;health
I would support a devolution of power out of Washington for education, health care, transportation.;Jim DeMint;health
It begins and ends with money. It's absurd in this day and age when we need so much money for education, health, for people, that a $100 million dollars can be spent on a film. It's obscene.;Kathleen Turner;health
All the evidence shows very clearly that if you are a member of a trade union you are likely to get better pay, more equal pay, better health and safety, more chance to get training, more chance to have conditions of work that help if you have caring responsibilities... the list goes on!;Frances O'Grady;health
True health care reform cannot happen in Washington. It has to happen in our kitchens, in our homes, in our communities. All health care is personal.;Mehmet Oz;health
We are spending most of our time in American health care fixing the mistakes that either we in the profession are causing or our patients are, without recognizing it, causing to themselves.;Mehmet Oz;health
I saw many people who had advanced heart disease and I was so frustrated because I knew if they just knew how to do the right thing, simple lifestyle and diet steps, that the entire trajectory of their life and health would have been different.;Mehmet Oz;health
Illegal immigration costs taxpayers $45 billion a year in health care, education, and incarceration expenses.;Ric Keller;health
Lack of time is a real health killer.;Marilu Henner;health
Alaska is what happens when Willy Wonka and the witch from Hansel and Gretel elope, buy a place together upstate, renounce their sweet teeth, and turn into health fanatics.;Sloane Crosley;health
When I was on Broadway, I got really sick with walking pneumonia. I decided not to take my health for granted anymore and make it a priority. The great thing is, the pounds just started to fall off.;Jordin Sparks;health
And I think of that again as I've written in several of my beauty books, a lot of health comes from the proper eating habits, which are something that - you know, I come from a generation that wasn't - didn't have a lot of food.;Joan Collins;health
I think health is another exceedingly important thing.;Joan Collins;health
I believe that parents need to make nutrition education a priority in their home environment. It's crucial for good health and longevity to instill in your children sound eating habits from an early age.;Cat Cora;health
Many health care providers, particularly physicians in rural and urban areas, are leaving the Government programs because of inadequate reimbursement rates.;Ron Wyden;health
It's time to look beyond the budget ax to assure access to health care for all. It's time to look for bipartisan solutions to the problems we can tackle today, and to work together for tomorrow - building a health care system that works for all Americans.;Ron Wyden;health
Fixing health care and fixing the economy are two sides of the same coin.;Ron Wyden;health
For the amount of money that the country is going to spend this year on health care, you can go out and hire a doctor for every seven families in the US and pay the doctor almost $230,000 a year to cover them.;Ron Wyden;health
I believe the most important aspect of Medicare is not the structure of the program but the guarantee to all Americans that they will have high quality health care as they get older.;Ron Wyden;health
When the Veterans Affairs Department implemented a program to provide home-based health care to veterans with multiple chronic conditions - many of the system's most expensive patients to treat - they received astounding results.;Ron Wyden;health
Without Free Choice Vouchers, there is little in the health reform law that discourages employers from increasingly passing the burden of health care costs onto their employees.;Ron Wyden;health
The reality is that the special interest groups that have lobbied against Free Choice Vouchers object to any measure that would empower employees to have a say in their health benefits because it begins to erode their power in the current health care system.;Ron Wyden;health
It is hard to miss the irony in the fact that the very same week that Republicans were publicly heralding Congressman Paul Ryan's plan to inject market forces into the American health care system, they were crafting a budget deal to strip them from the health reform law.;Ron Wyden;health
While Free Choice Vouchers didn't fulfill my vision of a health care system in which every American would be empowered to hire and fire their insurance company, they were a foothold for choice and competition and a safety valve for Americans whose employers are already forcing them to bear more and more of their family's health insurance costs.;Ron Wyden;health
It's correct that I wanted health reform to do more to create choices and promote competition.;Ron Wyden;health
Americans are free to choose everything from what they eat, drive and watch on TV to the President of the United States. Yet, when it comes to allowing Americans to choose the health insurance that works best for them and their family, the freedom to choose suddenly becomes un-American.;Ron Wyden;health
I agree with just about everyone in the reform debate when they say 'If you like what you have, you should be able to keep it.' But the truth is that none of the health reform bills making their way through Congress actually delivers on that promise.;Ron Wyden;health
If you like the health insurance that you have you should be able to keep it, but if you don't like the health insurance you have, you should be able to choose something else.;Ron Wyden;health
I believe that whether you love your job or hate your job, get laid off or are just in-between jobs, you deserve health care that can never be taken away.;Ron Wyden;health
Under the Healthy Americans Act, you're in charge of your health care - not your employer. If you lose your job, change jobs or just can't find a job, your health insurance is guaranteed to stick with you.;Ron Wyden;health
With a host of proposals on the table and a President examining new ideas for health reform, we have an obligation to give real reform our best shot.;Ron Wyden;health
To help the poor to a capacity for action and liberty is something essential for one's own health as well as theirs: there is a needful gift they have to offer which cannot be offered so long as they are confined by poverty.;Rowan D. Williams;health
Because of the president's leadership, every American will have access to affordable, quality health care.;Rahm Emanuel;health
Teaching kids about health and fitness is important to me. It's about being fit for life.;Jackie Joyner-Kersee;health
A life coach does for the rest of your life what a personal trainer does for your health and fitness.;Elaine MacDonald;health
Today the demands are for even higher standards in the quality of care, for greater flexibility and convenience in treatment times, and for more prevention through screening and health checks.;Lucy Powell;health
I don't think there's a shortage of material in the world. Or in my head. I just pray for continued good health, because I've got other stories to tell.;Richard Russo;health
Your 40s are a major trough. About the age of 50, feelings of satisfaction begin to rebound and keep rising into your 50s, 60s and 70s, with health being a major factor.;Jane Pauley;health
In the beginning when I sat next to Tom Brokaw on the 'Today' show, the stories I was interested in were those having to do with women and children and learning and health. In those days, 25 to 30 years ago, that was called soft news, and not in a nice way.;Jane Pauley;health
I used to drink tons of caffeine. Now I make smoothies with frozen berries and Green Vibrance health powder.;Leighton Meester;health
I am interested in getting people to use the healthcare system at the right time, getting them to see the doctor early enough, before a small health problem turns serious.;Donna Shalala;health
Hey 'Bachelor,' take notes! Trusting one another and sharing a journey to health leads to lasting relationships!;Alison Sweeney;health
One of the things I like best about 'Biggest Loser' is being around people who are trying to make the right choices. When you feel defeated about your weight and your health, like there's no hope, and you still make the choice to fight for it, to make the change happen no matter what people say or think, that's inspiring to me.;Alison Sweeney;health
Nothing is more capable of troubling our reason, and consuming our health, than secret notions of jealousy in solitude.;Aphra Behn;health
I'm happy that I feel a little less out of place in filmmaking than I once was - but it's almost impossible for a playwright in the U.S. to make a living. You can have a play, like I did with 'Angels,' and it still generates income for me, but it's not enough for me to live on and have health insurance.;Tony Kushner;health
Each State has its own health insurance mandates, and some of them are good, but there are about 1,800 of them all across the Nation, including provisions for acupuncturists, massage therapists, and hair replacements.;Timothy Murphy;health
We need better neighbors, neighbors that care about the schools in their neighborhood whether they have kids in them or not, because they know that the health and vitality of that neighborhood depends on it.;Thomas Friedman;health
Make no mistake, a 'yes' vote on the Democrats' health care bill is a vote for taxpayer-funded abortions.;John Boehner;health
The public health of five million children should not be left to luck or chance.;Jamie Oliver;health
Productive achievement is a consequence and an expression of health and self-esteem, not its cause.;Nathaniel Branden;health
The health effects of air pollution imperil human lives. This fact is well-documented.;Eddie Bernice Johnson;health
Today we have a health insurance industry where the first and foremost goal is to maximize profits for shareholders and CEOs, not to cover patients who have fallen ill or to compensate doctors and hospitals for their services. It is an industry that is increasingly concentrated and where Americans are paying more to receive less.;Dianne Feinstein;health
America has the best doctors, the best nurses, the best hospitals, the best medical technology, the best medical breakthrough medicines in the world. There is absolutely no reason we should not have in this country the best health care in the world.;Bill Frist;health
Well, the truth is that a lot of people lie about their health, they lie about the finances, they lie about things at work, they lie about things.;Laura Schlessinger;health
I don't know of a Democrat - whether they're a conservative, a centrist or a liberal Democrat - that doesn't think that it's important to have quality jobs that pay decent wages so that families can support themselves, so that they can have the dignity of being able to afford health care, put money aside for pension, buy a home.;Tom Vilsack;health
I don't know if there is a Democrat who necessarily doesn't believe health care is a right instead of privilege. There is a significant between us and the Republican Party on that issue.;Tom Vilsack;health
We know that there are significant health benefits from consuming more fruits and vegetables, and that's an opportunity for us to sort of move away from some of the meals that we've been preparing in the past.;Tom Vilsack;health
I have no regrets. I've got my health.;Naomi Campbell;health
Spiritually good people, pure in heart, who long for the Blessed Sacrament but cannot receive at the time, can receive spiritually... even a hundred times a day, in sickness and in health, with immeasurable grace and profit.;Johannes Tauler;health
I'm 58 years old and I just went through 8 back surgeries. They started cutting on me in February 2009, and I was basically bed ridden for almost two years. I got a real dose of reality that if you don't have your health, you don't have anything.;Hulk Hogan;health
I have a lot of health anxiety.;Charlie Kaufman;health
Advances in technology will continue to reach far into every sector of our economy. Future job and economic growth in industry, defense, transportation, agriculture, health care, and life sciences is directly related to scientific advancement.;Christopher Bond;health
Many smart folks seem to think that if you just get your metaphors and messages right, you'll win. That if you start describing what you favor as a 'moral value' - 'affordable health care is a moral value' etc., - then you'll appeal to red-state voters.;Eric Liu;health
There are all kinds of things you can do to marry literacy with health.;C. Everett Koop;health
I think that age as a number is not nearly as important as health. You can be in poor health and be pretty miserable at 40 or 50. If you're in good health, you can enjoy things into your 80s.;Bob Barker;health
I'd like to see the health care professionals making decisions, not some bureaucrat in Indianapolis working for an insurance company.;Charles Schumer;health
Voters did say 'repeal health care,' they did say 'reduce the size of government.' But not a single one of them from the tea party or anywhere said 'give tax breaks to the wealthiest.';Charles Schumer;health
I became a vegetarian out of compassion for animals and to live as healthy as possible. I realized soon after that I was truly concerned with nonviolent consumption and my own health, a vegan diet was the best decision.;Davey Havok;health
I'm by no means condemning prescription medicine for mental health. I've seen it save a lot of people's lives.;Zach Braff;health
We are all born with a unique genetic blueprint, which lays out the basic characteristics of our personality as well as our physical health and appearance... And yet, we all know that life experiences do change us.;Joan D. Vinge;health
Women are half the population and they know how to take care of themselves, if they are only given access to health care.;Cynthia Nixon;health
The idea of making access to safe abortions harder and more expensive and more difficult, having to travel across state lines - that puts women's health and lives in jeopardy, which is something I think no one wants.;Cynthia Nixon;health
Women's health needs to be front and center - it often isn't, but it needs to be.;Cynthia Nixon;health
The more easily digestible and refined the carbohydrates, the greater the effect on our health, weight and well-being.;Andrew Weil;health
Most American diets, even bad ones, provide more than enough calcium for bone health, especially for men.;Andrew Weil;health
I fully support a national health care program for the U.S.;Andrew Weil;health
One of the most obvious ways dogs can improve our physical and mental health is via daily walks.;Andrew Weil;health
The bottom line is that the human body is complex and subtle, and oversimplifying - as common sense sometimes impels us to do - can be hazardous to your health.;Andrew Weil;health
Human beings have survived for millennia because most of us make good decisions about our health most of the time.;Andrew Weil;health
If we can make the correct diagnosis, the healing can begin. If we can't, both our personal health and our economy are doomed.;Andrew Weil;health
The World Health Organization has recognized acupuncture as effective in treating mild to moderate depression.;Andrew Weil;health
I have argued for years that we do not have a health care system in America. We have a disease-management system - one that depends on ruinously expensive drugs and surgeries that treat health conditions after they manifest rather than giving our citizens simple diet, lifestyle and therapeutic tools to keep them healthy.;Andrew Weil;health
I am not against all forms of high-tech medicine. Drugs and surgeries have a secure place in the treatment of serious health conditions. But modern American medicine treats almost every health condition as if it were an emergency.;Andrew Weil;health
The most common objection that I hear to walking as exercise is that it's too easy, that only sweaty, strenuous activity offers real benefits. But there is abundant evidence that regular, brisk walking is associated with better health, including lower blood pressure, better moods and improved cholesterol ratios.;Andrew Weil;health
It does kids no favors, and sets them up for a potential lifetime of poor health and social embarrassment, to excuse them from family meals of real food. Everyone benefits from healthy eating, but it is particularly crucial at the beginning of life.;Andrew Weil;health
Citizens must pressure the American Hospital Association, the American Public Health Association, the Centers for Disease Control and other relevant governmental agencies to make greening our hospitals and medical centers a top priority so that they themselves don't create even more illness.;Andrew Weil;health
