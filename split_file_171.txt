Local innovation and initiative can help us better understand how to protect our environment.;Gale Norton;environmental
Why has it seemed that the only way to protect the environment is with heavy-handed government regulation?;Gale Norton;environmental

Moreover, the practical recommendations deduced from ecological principles threaten the vested interests of commerce it is hardly surprising that the financial and political power created by these investments should be used sometimes to suppress environmental impact studies.;Garrett Hardin;environmental
Factory farming is one of the biggest contributors to the most serious environmental problems. The meat industry causes more greenhouse gas emissions than all the cars, trucks, planes and ships in the world.;Joan Jett;environmental

In the environmental movement, every time you lose a battle it's for good, but our victories always seem to be temporary and we keep fighting them over and over again.;David Suzuki;environmental
Environmental concern is a little like dieting or paying off credit-card debt - an episodically terrific idea that burns brightly and then seems to fade when we realize there's a reason we need to diet or pay down our debt. The reason is that it's really, really hard, and too many of us in too many spheres of life choose the easy over the hard.;Jon Meacham;environmental
I always thought we had an environmental problem, but I hadn't realized how urgent it was. James Lovelock writes that by the end of this century there will be one billion people left.;Vivienne Westwood;environmental

I don't see this planet being... they're talking about how they're turning around the environmental problems here, but I think it's already too late.;Ace Frehley;environmental

I am going to confront the old-fashioned negative thinking which says that all government needs to do to generate growth is cut worker and environmental protections, cut taxes on the rich and stroke 'fat cats' until they purr with pleasure.

We need to accept the seemingly obvious fact that a toxic environment can make people sick and that no amount of medical intervention can protect us. The health care community must become a powerful political lobby for environmental policy and legislation.;Andrew Weil;environmental

Mark Ruffalo, aka the Incredible Hulk, is the natural gas industry's worst nightmare: a serious, committed activist who is determined to use his star power as a superhero in the hottest movie of the moment to draw attention the environmental and public health risks of fracking.;Jeff Goodell;environmental
Have we failed to slow global warming pollution in part because climate and environmental activists have been too polite and well behaved?;Jeff Goodell;environmental

The position I took at the time was that we hadn't really examined any of the potential environmental consequences of introducing genetically modified organisms.;Jeremy Rifkin;environmental
The industrial processes in use today were developed at a time when no one had to consider what the environmental impact was. Who cared?

The most important environmental issue is one that is rarely mentioned, and that is the lack of a conservation ethic in our culture.;Gaylord Nelson;environmental

Civilization has given us enormous successes: going to the moon, technology. But then this is the civilisation that took us to debt, environmental crisis, every single crisis. We need a civilization where we say goodbye to these things.;Muhammad Yunus;environmental
To be clear, climate change is a true 800 pound gorilla in the room. The effects of global warming threaten global environmental upheaval over the coming century. But for South Florida and the Everglades, it could be our death knell if urgent action is not taken.;Debbie Wasserman Schultz;environmental
You cannot achieve environmental security and human development without addressing the basic issues of health and nutrition.;Gro Harlem Brundtland;environmental
I don't think it's too hippie to want to clean up the planet so you don't wind up dying of some kind of cancer when you're 45 years old. It enrages me that these big cancer-research organizations can't be bothered to man the front lines of environmental protest.;Jello Biafra;environmental
The environmental benefits of hydrogen are also outstanding. When used as an energy source, hydrogen produces no emissions besides water. Zero polluting emissions, an amazing advance over the current sources of energy that we use.;Dan Lipinski;environmental
Hydrogen holds great promise to meet many of our future energy needs, and it addresses national security and our environmental concerns. Hydrogen is the simplest, most abundant element in the universe.;Dan Lipinski;environmental
By cutting critical domestic programs such as education, health, environmental protection, and veterans' services, this budget reveals misplaced priorities.;Dan Lipinski;environmental
There are nuclear weapons in China, Iran, Korea and Pakistan. It wouldn't take much to send a couple of warheads off on this planet somewhere that would cause a lot of environmental damage, then if you have got someone who wants to retaliate you have real problems.;Edward James Olmos;environmental
I'd say that animal rights and environmental issues have always been at the forefront of my mind.;Corey Feldman;environmental

In every case, the environmental hazards were made known only by independent scientists, who were often bitterly opposed by the corporations responsible for the hazards.;Barry Commoner;environmental
By adopting the control strategy, the nation's environmental program has created a built-in antagonism between environmental quality and economic growth.;Barry Commoner;environmental
Environmental quality was drastically improved while economic activity grew by the simple expedient of removing lead from gasoline - which prevented it from entering the environment.;Barry Commoner;environmental
The wave of new productive enterprises would provide opportunities to remedy the unjust distribution of environmental hazards among economic classes and racial and ethnic communities.;Barry Commoner;environmental
The environmental crisis is a global problem, and only global action will resolve it.;Barry Commoner;environmental
